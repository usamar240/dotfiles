My configuration files to help me set new machines easily.
First install all these dependencies correctly.
Then apply the dot files using

#+begin_src bash
  chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/usamar240/dotfiles.git
#+end_src

* Dependencies:
** Chezmoi
It is the actual configuration management system
Install using

sh -c "$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)" -- -b $HOME/.local/bin

** i3wm
Install i3 window manager using 
** Alacritty terminal
** Spacemacs
Simple installation using the git clone
** Python development
I will need to set up the virtual environment system I need 
Then I can make a develop virtual environment with all the linters that I need
Also need to add this environment to the path so Emacs can find executables
Also I still need to figure out what sort of process I need to adopt 

** Prose Linters
These should work in org-mode, latex, rst and text.
proselint
textlint



* Work
Then I also need to set the ssh access, I can find these details in my org notes.
After setting up ssh I can import my org notes.
These would also have information about any projects that I am currently working on etc.
Then I can go about setting any further things I need for my projects.
